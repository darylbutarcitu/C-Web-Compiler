C - Web Compiler v1.0
This is a simple web-based C compiler built using React and allows users to write, compile, and run C code in their browser. The app provides an interface where users can write C code, compile it using a backend server, and view the terminal output in real-time. This is a personal project I'm working on to explore and learn more about web-based C compilers.

Features:
Editor Integration: Provides a rich text editor for writing C code with syntax highlighting and error checking.
Terminal Output: After compiling, the output of the C program is shown in a terminal window inside the app.
Draggable Terminal: The terminal window is draggable, allowing users to position it as desired.

Limitations:
- Currently, user input functions like scanf, fgets, and similar are not supported.
- Multiple files compilation is not supported at the moment; only single-file programs are functional.
- etc...
